        <p class="text">
          Account-based sales is a sales strategy that focuses on selling to
          specific target accounts or <br />organizations, rather than
          individual prospects. This approach is often used in B2B sales and is
          <br />designed to deliver a highly personalized and tailored sales
          experience to each target account.<br />
          <br />

          In an account-based sales model, sales teams will conduct research to
          identify key decision-makers <br />within the target account and
          create a strategic plan to engage and build relationships with <br />
          those individuals. This can involve a variety of tactics, such as
          account-based marketing, <br />executive events, and personalized
          communication. The goal of an account-based sales strategy<br />
          is to create a highly relevant and valuable experience for the target
          account, which will<br />
          increase the chances of a successful sale.<br /><br />

          This approach is becoming increasingly popular as B2B buyers become
          more savvy and expect a <br />higher level of personalization and
          engagement from sales teams. By focusing on a smaller <br />number of
          high-value accounts, sales teams can drive more revenue and create
          more efficient <br />and effective sales processes.<br />
